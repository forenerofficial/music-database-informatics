This project showcases a music database built from an Access `.accdb` file, with table schemas, queries, and visualizations. It is designed for portfolio purposes to demonstrate database design, query writing, and data relationships.

## Features

- **Schema Design:** Tables for Artists, Playlists, Songs, Users, etc.
- **Queries:** Includes joins, aggregates, and ordering queries.
- **ERD Visualization:** Shows relationships between tables.
- **Portfolio-ready Screenshots:** Query results and report views.

## Sample Queries
1. List all songs in a playlist with artist names.
2. Count the number of songs per playlist.
3. Top artists by appearances in playlists.
4. Playlists created by each user.
5. Songs ordered by date added in a playlist.
6. Monthly listeners of artists in each playlist.
   
## Notes

- SQL files are compatible with MySQL syntax.
- Album cover images are a small sample for demonstration.
- Designed for portfolio presentation \'97 recruiters can review schema, relationships, and queries without needing the original Access file.
